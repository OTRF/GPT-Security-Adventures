      "1. Research flights: First, check for flights from major airports near Virginia (such as Dulles International Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport) to Lima, Peru's capital city. Major airlines that operate flights between these two destinations include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Book your flight: Once you've found a suitable flight, book it online through the airline's website or a travel booking site like Expedia or Kayak. Be sure to consider the cost of the flight, layovers, and connection times.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Apply for a Peruvian visa (if required): US citizens do not require a visa for stays in Peru of up to 90 days, but it's always best to double-check the requirements before departing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Arrange transportation from Lima to Cusco: After arriving in Lima, you can take a connecting flight or a bus to Cusco (the closest major city to Machu Picchu). Popular bus companies include Cruz del Sur and Oltursa. Alternatively, you may choose to take the train directly to Aguas Calientes, the nearest town to Machu Picchu.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Plan your visit to Machu Picchu: The entrance to Machu Picchu is located in Aguas Calientes. You can either hike the Inca Trail or take a bus up to the site. It's recommended to book your tickets online in advance, as they sell out quickly during peak tourist season.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Prepare for the trip: Pack appropriate clothing and gear for the altitude and weather conditions. Consider hiring a guide or taking a tour to make the most of your visit to Machu Picchu. Also, remember to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and insect repellent.\n",
