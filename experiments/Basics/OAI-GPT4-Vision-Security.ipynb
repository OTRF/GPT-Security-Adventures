The AD FS service executable Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe loads the said DLL file via the DLL search order hijacking technique that involves the core Common Language Runtime (CLR) DLL files (described in detail in the FoggyWeb loader section). This loader is responsible for loading the encrypted FoggyWeb backdoor file and utilizing a custom Lightweight Encryption Algorithm (LEA) routine to decrypt the backdoor in memory.\n",

    "After de-obfuscating the backdoor, the loader proceeds to load FoggyWeb in the execution context of the AD FS application. The loader, an unmanaged application, leverages the CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load the backdoor, a managed DLL, in the same Application Domain within which the legitimate AD FS managed code is executed. This grants the backdoor access to the AD FS codebase and resources, including the AD FS configuration database (as it inherits the AD FS service account permissions required to access the configuration database)."

      "This image represents a high-level overview of how a threat actor might leverage the Windows operating system's internal mechanisms to attack Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) by injecting a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library). \n",
      "\n",
      "The concepts illustrated include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Common Language Runtime (CLR):** Part of the Microsoft .NET framework, the CLR provides a managed execution environment for .NET programs, handling various system services including memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security, and thread management.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **DLL Loading:** The process where executable programs (like Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe) load additional libraries during runtime to access more functionality. Notably, `mscoree.dll` and `mscoreei.dll` are essential components of the .NET runtime that help with running managed code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker exploits the order that Windows searches for a DLL when one is not found in the immediate directory. If a malicious DLL is named identically to a genuine, expected DLL and placed in a directory earlier on in the search path, it could be loaded in place of the legitimate DLL.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the attacker uses a fake `version.dll` strategically located in a path the executable searches before reaching the legitimate DLL. Windows tries to load the expected `version.dll` from the usual locations and ends up picking up the attacker's DLL.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **AppDomain:** A unit of isolation within the CLR that can host managed code. Each application domain remains protected from errors and malicious activities in other application domains. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **AD FS Code:** The actual functional code for the AD FS service that should be running securely and reliably in its dedicated AppDomain.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **FoggyWeb Backdoor DLL:** This would represent the attacker's malicious payload. Named to look like a normal DLL that should be loaded by the AD FS service, the \"FoggyWeb\" backdoor could execute malicious code, compromising the server and potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, the threat actor executes their code in the context of the AD FS application, effectively compromising it. This sort of attack relies on having enough access to the system to place the malicious DLL in a directory that the service will search for DLLs, which might require elevated privileges.\n",

The type of memory allocation requested includes both reserving and committing memory (with the `MEM_RESERVE` and `MEM_COMMIT` flags), and the page protection is set to allow execution and read/write access (`PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`).\n",

Shellcode typically is a small piece of code used after exploiting a vulnerability, frequently used to open a shell or reverse shell to gain control of the target machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If writing to process memory fails, it prints an error message, releases the allocated memory with `VirtualFreeEx`, closes the process handle, and returns 1.\n",

      "7. A new thread is created within the target process by calling `CreateRemoteThread`, with the start routine being the address of the remote buffer where the shellcode was written.\n",
